					Started becoming interested in technology at a relatively young age. When I first got my hands on a computer, the feeling of curiosity was addicting. Distinctly remember going on the role-playing game Webkinz as a way of escaping the real world. Creating and modeling my Webkinz home how I saw fit gave me a sense of control. The feeling that anything was possible gave me confidence. To this day, I still have that feeling of excitement when on a computer and I hope it never goes away!
